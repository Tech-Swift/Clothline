      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Majestic, your number one source for all things thrifted. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of second-hand clothing, with a focus on quality, affordability, and sustainability.</p>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2023 by Marto, Majestic has come a long way from its beginnings in a small home office. When Marto first started out, his passion for eco-friendly fashion drove him to quit his day job, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the fair trade wing of the fashion industry.</p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to provide high-quality, affordable, and sustainable clothing options to fashion-conscious individuals. We believe in the power of thrifted fashion to make a positive impact on the environment and the community.</p>
